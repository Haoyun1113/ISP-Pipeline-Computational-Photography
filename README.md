An Image Signal Processor (ISP) pipeline is a critical component in modern digital cameras and smartphones, responsible for converting raw sensor data into a processed and visually appealing image. Here is an overview of the typical stages in an ISP pipeline:

#### 1. Lens shading Correction(LSC) -
- Corrects vignetting or shading effects caused by the lens.
- Ensures uniform brightness across the image.
- Vignetting is a reduction in brightness at the periphery of an image compared to the center, leading to uneven illumination.

#### 2. Black Level Correction (BLC)

- Removes any bias or offset introduced by the sensor.
- Sets the correct black level for the image.
